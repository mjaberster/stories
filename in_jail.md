INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT

A man, JIM (30s), wakes up groggily on a hard cot. He looks around, confused and disoriented. He tries to stand but stumbles and falls back onto the cot.

JIM
(muttering to himself)
Where the hell am I?

He looks around the cell, taking in the gray walls, the metal bars, and the small window high up on one wall. He notices a small camera mounted in the corner of the ceiling.

JIM
(louder)
Hello? Is anyone there?

He waits a moment but there is no response. He stands up again, more steady this time, and approaches the bars.

JIM
(yelling)
Hey! I need to talk to someone!

He waits again but still no response. He turns around and starts pacing back and forth, running his hands through his hair.

JIM
(to himself)
Think, think, think. What the hell happened?

He stops pacing and turns to the camera.

JIM
(pleadingly)
Please, someone tell me what's going on.

He waits but still no response. He sinks down to the floor, his head in his hands.

JIM
(whispering)
What have I done?

The sound of a door opening and footsteps approaching can be heard. Jim looks up as the guard, (guard name) enters the cell with a tray of food.

GUARD

You have been arrested for a crime, you'll be informed of the charges in the morning.

JIM

What crime? I don't even remember what happened!

GUARD

That's not my concern. Eat your food, you'll have a long day ahead.

The guard drops the tray on the floor and leaves the cell, the door slamming shut behind him. Jim looks down at the tray, his stomach turning. He doesn't think he'll be able to eat anything. He lays back down on the cot, staring up at the ceiling.

JIM
(to himself)
I need to figure out what's going on and clear my name.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of Jim's determined breathing.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Jim is led into the room by the guard and seated at a small table. Across from him sit two detectives, DETECTIVE JOHNSON (50s) and DETECTIVE SMITH (40s). They both have stern expressions on their faces as they begin to speak.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Jim, we have charged you with the murder of a prominent mafia leader.

JIM

(shocked)
What? I didn't do anything! I don't even remember what happened!

DETECTIVE SMITH

According to our evidence, you were seen at the scene of the crime and your fingerprints were found on the murder weapon.

JIM

(desperate)
That can't be right! I swear, I didn't do anything!

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

Jim, we understand that you may be confused or have a gap in your memory, but the evidence is clear.

JIM

(pleadingly)
Please, you have to believe me. I didn't do this.

DETECTIVE SMITH

We'll take your plea into consideration, but right now we need you to help us understand what happened. Can you tell us anything about the night in question?

JIM

(frustrated)
I already told you, I don't remember anything!

The detectives exchange a glance before DETECTIVE JOHNSON speaks again.

DETECTIVE JOHNSON

We'll be continuing our investigation, but for now, you'll be held in custody.

JIM

(defeated)
I'll do whatever it takes to clear my name.

The detectives stand up and leave the room, leaving Jim alone at the table. He buries his face in his hands, feeling hopeless and helpless.

JIM
(to himself)
I need to find a way to prove my innocence.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of Jim's determined breathing.

INT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

We see a dimly lit room, with a large figure lying on the ground, surrounded by a pool of blood. The camera pans around the room, showing broken furniture and signs of a struggle. We see a glimpse of a figure in the background, standing in the shadows. The figure is Jim, and he appears to be holding something in his hand.

JIM (V.O.)
(muttering to himself)
What the hell is going on?

Suddenly, the sound of footsteps and voices can be heard. Jim quickly hides the object in his hand behind his back and steps out of the shadows.

JIM (V.O.)
(panicking)
Oh my God, I need to get out of here.

He starts to move towards the door, but he is caught by a group of people, who appear to be the police or the investigation team.

JIM (V.O.)
(terrified)
No, no, no. This can't be happening.

The scene cuts back to the present, where Jim is still sitting in the interrogation room, looking defeated and scared.

JIM (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
I was there, I was involved in the crime, but I don't remember anything, I don't remember killing anyone, I need to figure out what happened and how to clear my name.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of Jim's determined breathing.

INT. JAIL DINING HALL - DAY

Jim is sitting at a table by himself, picking at his food. The hall is crowded with inmates, mostly Asian men, and Jim can feel their eyes on him as they whisper and point. He feels terrified and out of place. He looks around, trying to find an escape route. Suddenly, an Asian man, MR. LEE (40s) approaches his table.

MR. LEE

(in broken English)
You not belong here.

JIM

(nervously)
I-I don't know what you mean.

MR. LEE

(gesturing to the other Asian inmates)
We protect you. You not guilty.

JIM

(confused)
What? How do you know that?

MR. LEE

(nodding towards the guards)
They lie. We know truth.

Jim looks around, seeing the other Asian inmates nodding in agreement. He feels a wave of relief wash over him.

JIM

(grateful)
Thank you. But, why would you want to protect me?

MR. LEE

(smiling)
We all family. We look out for each other.

JIM

(tearfully)
Thank you. I won't let you down.

Jim starts to eat his food, feeling a sense of belonging and protection. He looks around the hall, noticing the other inmates' faces, and realizes that he is not alone in this fight.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of the inmates talking and laughing.

INT. JAIL CELL - DAY

Jim is sitting on his cot, staring blankly at the wall. The sound of a commotion outside his cell grabs his attention, and he stands up to see what's happening. A group of guards are gathered outside of the cell next to his, and he can see a body covered in a white sheet being carried out on a stretcher. His heart sinks as he recognizes the cell as the one belonging to Mr. Lee.

JIM
(whispering to himself)
No, no, no. This can't be happening.

He approaches the cell, trying to get a closer look, but a guard stops him.

GUARD

(sternly)
You need to go back to your cell, now.

JIM

(desperate)
Please, tell me what's going on. Was that Mr. Lee?

GUARD

(unresponsive)
I can't give you any information.

JIM

(pleadingly)
He was helping me, please tell me what happened.

The guard doesn't respond, and Jim is forcibly escorted back to his cell. He falls onto his cot, feeling a sense of hopelessness and fear wash over him.

JIM (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
Mr. Lee was the only one who believed me, now he's gone. I'm all alone again. And If Mr. Lee is dead, it means that someone wants me dead too.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of Jim's panicked breathing.

INT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

We see a dimly lit room, with a large figure lying on the ground, surrounded by a pool of blood. Jim is standing in the shadows, looking around frantically. Mr. Lee approaches him, holding a gun.

MR. LEE

(urgently)
We need to leave now, before the police arrive.

JIM

(shocked)
What? No, I didn't do this.

MR. LEE

(firmly)
I know you didn't. I did it.

JIM

(confused)
What? Why?

MR. LEE

(narrowing his eyes)
He was a bad man. He hurt our people. He deserved it.

JIM

(stammering)
But, but you can't just kill someone.

MR. LEE

(determined)
I did what needed to be done. And now, you need to come with me.

JIM

(hesitant)
I, I can't. I can't be a part of this.

MR. LEE

(grabbing Jim's arm)
You already are. Now come on.

Mr. Lee drags Jim out of the crime scene, and the scene cuts back to the present, where Jim is

INT. CRIME SCENE - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

We see a dimly lit room, with a large figure lying on the ground, surrounded by a pool of blood. Jim is standing in the shadows, looking around frantically. Mr. Lee approaches him, looking worried.

MR. LEE

(urgently)
We need to leave now, before the police arrive.

JIM

(shocked)
What? No, I didn't do this.

MR. LEE

(firmly)
I know you didn't. But you can't stay here, you need to come with me.

JIM

(confused)
What? Why? What's going on?

MR. LEE

(hesitant)
I can't say much, but trust me, it's for your own safety.

JIM

(stammering)
I don't understand.

MR. LEE

(grabbing Jim's arm)
You don't have to, just come with me.

Mr. Lee drags Jim out of the crime scene, and the scene cuts back to the present, where Jim is still sitting in the interrogation room, looking defeated and scared. He is now even more confused and unsure about what really happened.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Jim is sitting at a table with his lawyer, MR. THOMPSON (50s), dressed in a suit and looking confident. Across from them, the prosecution team is seated, led by DISTRICT ATTORNEY (DA) ROGERS (40s) who is going over papers and conferring with his team. The judge, JUDGE HARRIS (60s) is sitting at the front of the courtroom, looking over the proceedings.

MR. THOMPSON

(addressing the judge)
Your honor, I would like to request a postponement of the trial. My client, Jim, is currently suffering from a severe mental condition and is unable to assist in his own defense.

DA ROGERS

(objecting)
Your honor, this is just a delay tactic. The prosecution is ready to proceed with the trial.

JUDGE HARRIS

(addressing MR. THOMPSON)
Can you provide any evidence of your client's mental condition?

MR. THOMPSON

(nodding)
Yes, your honor. We have obtained a report from a licensed psychologist that attests to my client's current mental state.

JUDGE HARRIS

(looking over the report)
I will take this into consideration. Mr. Rogers, do you have any objections to a continuance?

DA ROGERS

(hesitant)
No, your honor. But I would like to request a competency evaluation for the defendant.

JUDGE HARRIS

(nodding)
Very well. The trial is continued for two weeks, during which time the defendant will undergo a competency evaluation.

MR. THOMPSON

(nodding)
Thank you, your honor.

JIM
(whispering to himself)
I hope this will help me to clear my name, but I am still scared, I don't know what will happen to me.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of the courtroom clearing and the judge's gavel banging.

INT. JIM'S HOME OFFICE - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Jim is sitting at his desk, surrounded by computer screens and code. He is typing away, completely engrossed in his work. Suddenly, his phone rings. He picks it up, and we see a look of confusion and fear cross his face as he listens to the person on the other end. He hangs up the phone without saying a word.

JIM
(muttering to himself)
What the hell was that?

He stands up, pacing back and forth, running his hands through his hair. He pulls out his cell phone and dials a number.

JIM
(urgently)
Honey? Are you okay?

We don't hear the response, but the look on Jim's face changes from fear to concern. He hangs up the phone and continues to pace back and forth.

JIM (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
Something is not right. I need to find out what's going on.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of Jim's determined breathing.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Jim is sitting at the witness stand, facing DA Rogers, who is standing in front of him with a notebook in his hand. The judge is sitting at the front of the courtroom, observing the proceedings.

DA ROGERS

(addressing Jim)
Mr. Jim, can you tell us about the night of the incident? What were you doing in your office?

JIM

(nervously)
I was working on a project for my company, coding on my computer.

DA ROGERS

(nodding)
And how did you become aware of the incident?

JIM

(hesitantly)
I received a phone call, but I don't remember who it was from or what was said.

DA ROGERS

(pressing)
And what did you do after the call?

JIM

(hesitantly)
I, I'm not sure. I remember feeling scared and confused. I called my wife to make sure she was okay.

DA ROGERS

(suspiciously)
And how did you feel when you were at the crime scene? When you were standing over the body?

JIM

(hesitantly)
I don't remember being at the crime scene. I have no memory of that night.

DA ROGERS

(pressing)
But you were there, Mr. Jim. Your fingerprints were found on the murder weapon. How do you explain that?

JIM

(frustrated)
I don't know. I don't remember anything from that night.

DA ROGERS

(pacing)
And what about Mr. Lee? The man who was found dead in his cell? How did you feel when you heard about his death?

JIM

(sighs)
I was shocked and saddened by his death. He was the only one who believed me and was trying to help me.

DA ROGERS

(stops pacing)
And how did you feel when he looked directly into your eyes?

JIM

(pauses)
I-I can't answer that question. I don't remember.

DA ROGERS

(narrowing his eyes)
Are you sure, Mr. Jim? Or are you just hiding the truth?

The judge intervenes.

JUDGE HARRIS

(interrupting)
That's enough, Mr. Rogers. The witness has stated that he has no memory of the events in question.

DA ROGERS

(frustrated)
Your honor, I request that the witness undergoes hypnosis to retrieve his memories.

JUDGE HARRIS

(nodding)
I will take that under advisement. The court will recess for lunch, and we will reconvene this afternoon to hear the defense's case.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of the courtroom clearing and the judge's gavel banging.

INT. JIM'S HOME - DAY (FLASHBACK)

Jim is sitting on the couch, staring blankly at the wall. He looks disheveled, his clothes are dirty, and his eyes are red and puffy. We hear a knock on the door, and Jim doesn't move. The knock comes again, louder this time. Jim slowly stands up, wiping away tears, and makes his way to the door. He opens it to find a group of police officers standing outside.

POLICE OFFICER 1

(sternly)
James Thompson, you are under arrest for the murder of (name of the victim).

JIM

(whispering)
What? No, I didn't do it.

The officers step forward, and one of them places handcuffs on Jim's wrists.

POLICE OFFICER 1

(reading Jim his rights)
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

JIM

(voice trembling)
I didn't do it. I swear.

The officers lead Jim out of the house and into a patrol car. He looks back at the house, tears streaming down his face, as the car drives away.

JIM (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
This can't be happening. I didn't do it. But how did I end up here? What really happened that night?

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of the patrol car driving away.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Jim is sitting at the witness stand, facing DA Rogers, who is standing in front of him with a notebook in his hand. The judge is sitting at the front of the courtroom, observing the proceedings.

JUDGE HARRIS

(addressing the courtroom)
We will now proceed with the hypnosis session to help the witness retrieve his memories of the night in question.

Jim looks worried as a hypnotherapist is called to the stand and begins to guide Jim into a hypnotic state. Under hypnosis, Jim begins to recall details of the night in question, but the information is not clear and consistent. He can't really confirm what really happened that night.

DA ROGERS

(addressing the court)
Your honor, the witness's testimony under hypnosis is not reliable. He is still unable to recall the events of the night in question with any certainty.

JUDGE HARRIS

(nodding)
I agree. The court will take this into consideration when deliberating on the case.

The trial continues, with both sides presenting their evidence and arguments. In the end, the jury finds Jim not guilty due to lack of evidence and the court acquits him. Jim leaves the courtroom, feeling relieved but still struggling to understand what really happened that night.

JIM (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
I may have been acquitted, but I still don't know the truth. I need to find out what really happened that night and clear my name.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of Jim's determined footsteps echoing in the courtroom.

INT. JIM'S HOME - DAY (NEXT DAY)

Jim is sitting at the kitchen table, staring blankly at a cup of coffee in front of him. He looks tired and worn out. He stands up and begins to move around the kitchen, preparing breakfast. As he opens a drawer to grab a spoon, he notices a small piece of paper with a phone number scrawled on it and a symbol he doesn't recognize. He picks it up, staring at it for a moment before shrugging and setting it aside. He continues to make his breakfast, trying to push the thoughts of the trial out of his mind.

As he eats, we see various family photos and portraits on the walls and shelves of the home. We see Jim smiling with a woman and two children, who we can assume are his wife and children, but we don't know much about them yet.

JIM (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
I need to focus on moving forward, on rebuilding my life. But I can't shake the feeling that there's something I'm missing, something important.

He finishes his breakfast and goes to the living room, he sits on the couch and picks up the remote to turn on the TV, trying to distract himself from his thoughts, but the note and symbol keep coming back to his mind.

JIM (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
I need to find out what that note means, maybe it can give me some answers.

He gets up and grabs the note, he looks at the number, and then he dials it, the call goes through, and we see that the person on the other side picks up, but we don't hear what they say, the scene ends with Jim's face, looking determined, ready to find out what's going on.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING - DAY

Jim is seen walking up to a dilapidated building in a run-down neighborhood. He looks around nervously, checking to see if anyone is following him. He approaches the door and knocks. After a moment, the door opens, and a middle-aged Chinese man looks out. The man looks Jim up and down before nodding and gesturing for him to come in.

JIM

(nervously)
Thank you for seeing me.

The man doesn't say anything, but he leads Jim through a dark, narrow hallway and into a dimly lit room. The room is sparsely furnished, with just a few chairs and a small table. The man motions for Jim to take a seat, and then he sits across from him.

CHINESE MAN

(in a low voice)
You shouldn't have come here. It's not safe.

JIM

(urgently)
I had to. I need to know what's going on. That note, the symbol, it all ties back to you, doesn't it?

CHINESE MAN

(nodding)
Yes. But you should leave now. It's not safe for you to be here.

JIM

(determined)
I can't leave. Not until you tell me what's going on.

The Chinese man sighs and looks at Jim for a long moment before speaking.

CHINESE MAN

(hesiantly)
Fine. But you must understand, what I am about to tell you, it will change everything for you. Are you sure you want to know?

JIM

(nodding)
Yes, I have to know.

CHINESE MAN

(sighs)
Very well. But you must swear to keep this information to yourself, it could put not only you in danger, but also the people around you.

JIM

(nodding)
I swear, I won't tell anyone.

CHINESE MAN

(nodding)
Alright, I'll start from the beginning. My name is, it doesn't matter, you can call me Mr. Chen. I am part of a secret organization that's been around for centuries, our mission is to protect and preserve the balance of power. We were the ones who contacted you that night, we needed your help to take down a powerful criminal leader that was a threat to the balance of power. We knew you wouldn't remember anything, so we left you the note with my number, as a way to contact me if you ever needed help.

JIM

(stunned)
But why me? I'm just a programmer, I have no connections to the criminal world.

MR. CHEN

(smiling)
You are more than just
a programmer, James. You have skills and abilities that we saw potential in. And as for your lack of connections to the criminal world, that was precisely why we chose you. We needed someone who wouldn't be suspected, someone who could get close to the target without raising suspicion.

JIM

(processing the information)
But why did you make me think I was a suspect, a murderer?

MR. CHEN

(sighs)
It was necessary. We had to make it seem like you were the prime suspect to protect your identity and keep you safe. We couldn't risk the target finding out who you really were and coming after you.

JIM

(shaking his head)
I can't believe it. My whole life has been a lie.

MR. CHEN

(nodding)
I understand this is a lot to take in, but you must understand, what we do is for the greater good. And now that you know the truth, you have a choice to make. You can walk away and go back to your normal life, or you can join us in our mission to preserve the balance of power.

JIM

(thinking)
I need time to process all of this.

MR. CHEN

(nodding)
Take all the time you need. But remember, the choice is yours.

The scene fades to black as we see Jim leaving the building, looking dazed and confused, with a lot to think about.

up and he gets caught.
INT. PRISON - DAY

Mr. Lee is seen sitting in his cell, studying a blueprint of the prison. He is planning his escape, carefully going over the details in his mind. He knows he needs to be careful and not raise suspicion.

Mr. Lee begins to put his plan into action, carefully and covertly gathering the tools and supplies he needs. He bides his time, waiting for the perfect opportunity to make his move.

One night, when the guards are distracted, Mr. Lee makes his break for freedom. He manages to navigate the prison undetected and make it to the perimeter fence. He is just about to climb over when he is spotted by one of the guards.

The guard raises the alarm, and the prison goes into lockdown. Mr. Lee is surrounded by guards, and he knows he has been caught.

MR. LEE (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
I was so close. But someone set me up.

The scene cuts to an unknown person, watching the events unfold on a monitor. A smirk crosses their face, as they turn off the monitor and lean back in their chair.

MR. LEE (V.O)
(muttering to himself)
I need to find out who did this to me and make them pay.

The scene fades to black as we hear the sound of Mr. Lee being taken back to his cell, his determination and anger clear in his voice.
